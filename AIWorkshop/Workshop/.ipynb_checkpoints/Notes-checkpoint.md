# What is Machine Learning

## Conventional Programming

Input   -----> |         |
               | Machine | -----> Output
Program -----> |         | 

## Machine Learning

Input   -----> |         |
               | Machine | -----> Program
Output  -----> |         | 

# Steps involved in Machine Learning

1. Get the data
2. Clean, Prepare and Manipulate Data
3. Train Model
4. Test Data
5. Improve

The Learner has a background knowledge for understanding the data, the learner then creates a model, resolver

input, output --> | Learner with some Background Knowledge | --> | Resolver |

inputs and outputs are shown to the learner which creates a resolver that can provide outputs from unseen inputs

# Classification of ML

- ML
    - Supervised
        - Classification
        - Predicition
    - Unsupervised
        - Clustering
        
# Classification of Data

- Data
    - Labelled Data
        - for every input there is an output
        - number of columns is known as attribute / features
        - rows are the populations
        - supervised learning is used here
    - Unlabelled Data
        - only the inputs are given, the data can only be classified using the inputs
        - unsupervised learning is used here
        
## Supervised Learning

Develop predictive model based on both input and output

- Classification
    - Output is a fixed defined set, or discrete
    - Indentiy a unique class
    
- Predicition
    - Output is a continuous data
    
- Regression
    - Estimate Continuous values
    
## Unsupervised Learning

Develop predictive model based on only input

- Cluster Analysis

- Density Estimation

- Dimension Reduction

- Clustering
    - Discrete values can be clustered to groups
    - Grouping Homogeneous Data

- Speech Recognition
